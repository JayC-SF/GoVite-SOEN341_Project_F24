# SOEN341 Project (Fall 2024)

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a Peer Assessment Application for university team projects. The application allows students to evaluate the contributions of their teammates based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts.

## Project

This web application enables students to anonymously assess their peers at the end of a project or at key milestones using a 7-point rating scale. The system aggregates the scores, and instructors can view performance summaries for each student through a dashboard. The application supports the creation and management of teams and provides automated feedback to help students improve in future projects.

The key users are:

Students: Can log in to assess peers anonymously.
Instructors: Can create teams, view assessment results, and export data for further analysis.
